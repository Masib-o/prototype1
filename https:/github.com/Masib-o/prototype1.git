<h1>My life so far(-_-)</h1>

<!-- really cool coding stuff -->

 <p>I go by the name Shawn Masibo and as you probably have figured out I am an upcoming software developer. I am 14 yrs of age ;quiete young to code.
 My journey started a few months back during the initial attack from the deadly virus. I started as just learning something new sort of exploring my capabilities 
 but I know realize it is my destined path. </p>
 <p>My life doesn't revolve around code however as I am a dedicated football player.(for others:soccer) Anyway, I am involved deeply in the sport and it takes up a large part
 of my life.I have taken part in various competitios within Eastern Africa, winning most with my former team Firt Touch Soccer Kenya.</p>
